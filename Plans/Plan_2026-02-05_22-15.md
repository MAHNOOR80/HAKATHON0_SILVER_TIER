# Task Execution Plan — 2026-02-05

## Summary

- **Total Pending Tasks**: 2
- **High Priority**: 0
- **Awaiting Approval**: 0
- **Ready to Execute**: 2

### Tasks by Type
| Type | Count |
|------|-------|
| file_review | 2 |

## Suggested Execution Order

### Batch 1: Immediate (High Priority, No Approval)
_(No high priority tasks)_

### Batch 2: Needs Approval First
_(No tasks requiring approval)_

### Batch 3: Standard Priority
1. [x] **Review File: The Importance of Education.txt** — `task_The Importance of Education.txt.md` — ✓ Archived (educational essay)
2. [x] **Review File: user_notes.txt** — `task_user_notes.txt.md` — ✓ Archived (empty file flagged)

### Batch 4: Low Priority / Backlog
_(No low priority tasks)_

## Risks and Unclear Items

- [ ] **Both tasks**: Missing `approval_needed` and `mcp_action` fields — using older template format, recommend updating to Silver tier format
- [ ] **Task 1 & 2**: No explicit success criteria defined beyond basic checklist
- [ ] **Dependency**: Both tasks depend on files existing in `/Inbox/` — verify files are present before execution

## Strategy

Both pending tasks are file review tasks of medium priority, auto-generated by the File Watcher system. Recommend processing them sequentially in creation order (oldest first). Each task follows the same workflow: review file content, determine appropriate action (process, archive, or escalate), execute action, and mark complete. Before starting, verify the source files exist in the Inbox folder. After completion, move task files to `/Done/` per Company Handbook Rule 3. Consider updating these tasks to include the new Silver tier YAML fields (`approval_needed`, `mcp_action`) for better workflow tracking.
