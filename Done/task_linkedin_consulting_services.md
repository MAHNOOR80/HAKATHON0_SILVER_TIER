# LinkedIn Post: Consulting Services Promotion

## Draft Content

Most businesses don't need another full-time hire.

They need someone who can step in, understand the problem fast, and deliver results without the ramp-up.

That's exactly what I do.

I work with small and mid-size teams who need senior-level support on their terms. No long onboarding. No bloated contracts. Just clear deliverables and direct communication from day one.

Here's what that looks like in practice:
- Strategy and execution support tailored to your goals
- Hands-on problem solving, not slide decks
- Flexible engagement — project-based or ongoing, your call

The teams I work with are lean, moving fast, and don't have time to waste. If that sounds like yours, let's have a conversation.
